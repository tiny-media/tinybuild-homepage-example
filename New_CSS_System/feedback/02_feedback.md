Step 02 (Token System) is **correct** and **consistent** with the overall architecture, and it cleanly applies to an 11ty + Vite + LightningCSS setup with only small optional refinements suggested below.[1][2][3]

## Colors tokens
- Using OKLCH with var-based hue channels and native light-dark() is sound, modern, and aligns with CSS Color 4/5 guidance; the function requires color-scheme: light dark on the root, which is present.[2][3][4][5]
- The fallback block under @supports not (color: light-dark(...)) plus prefers-color-scheme ensures reasonable behavior on older Android/iOS without forcing extreme polyfills, while preserving explicit user overrides via [data-theme].[3][6][2]
- The semantic palette and surface/text hierarchy are coherent and token-driven; unused additions like --color-surface-sunken and --color-text-tertiary are fine to keep for future components.[2]

## Spacing tokens
- The fluid spacing scale via clamp is well-formed and balanced from 3xs to 3xl, and the alias tokens (--space-gutter, --space-section, --space-gap) provide practical ergonomics for layout utilities.[2]
- Values are expressed entirely in tokens with no magic numbers outside clamp endpoints, matching the architecture’s token-first principle.[1][2]

## Typography tokens
- The font stacks and fluid type scale are sensible, with unitless line-heights and letter-spacing tokens ready for components and classless defaults.[2]
- The scale increments are moderate and will pair well with semantic HTML defaults set in the base styles from Step 01.[7][2]

## Test HTML and paths
- The updated test page loads reset-and-base plus token files directly with root-absolute paths (/assets/...), which matches the Vite root: 'src' configuration shown in the overview.[1][2]
- This is appropriate for development; in production the main.css orchestration with an explicit @layer order should be used to guarantee consistent layering across files.[8][1]

## Fit for 11ty + Vite + LightningCSS
- The token files all live under @layer tokens and will merge predictably when imported via main.css, aligning with the overview’s declared layer order.[8][1][2]
- The plan relies on light-dark() and modern color spaces that are baseline in 2025 and progressive-enhanced via @supports for older devices, which is compatible with the stated “reasonable” backward support target.[3][1][2]

## Minor refinements (optional)
- Consider adding explicit overrides in the fallback for an explicit dark preference too (e.g., :root[data-theme="dark"]) alongside the existing :root:not([data-theme="light"]) to make intent crystal clear, though current selectors already behave correctly when the attribute is set.[2]
- When moving from the test setup to production, rely on the single orchestrated main.css with a top-level @layer statement to freeze layer precedence regardless of import order.[8][1]

## Conclusion
Step 02 delivers a robust, modular token system (colors, spacing, typography) that follows token-first and progressive enhancement principles, and it integrates cleanly with the 11ty + Vite + LightningCSS pipeline as designed.[3][1][2]
