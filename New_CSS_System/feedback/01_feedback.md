Yes—this 2025-first CSS architecture is broadly correct, internally consistent, and fits an 11ty + Vite + LightningCSS stack for a single developer, with only a few small adjustments to align anchor positioning syntax and paths for the Vite root setup.[1][2]

## Applies to setup
- The build config in the overview sets Vite root to src and outputs to _site, which maps well to 11ty + 11ty-plugin-vite, and uses LightningCSS for minification and modern transforms that this architecture relies on.[1]
- The approach minimizes JavaScript, leverages light-dark(), cascade layers, container queries, :has(), and native scoping—features that LightningCSS and modern browsers support, making it a strong fit for a solo 11ty workflow.[3][4][1]

## Key correctness checks
- Theme boot: meta color-scheme plus :root color-scheme and native light-dark() is the right “zero-flicker” path, and the fallback @supports not (color: light-dark(...)) with prefers-color-scheme is correct.[4][5][1]
- Tokens: OKLCH, balanced contrast, and semantic aliasing are all well-formed and compatible with modern engines; light-dark() requires color-scheme: light dark, which is present.[6][4][1]
- Scoping: @scope usage with :scope for component roots and container queries is correct and aligns with current MDN guidance on scoping proximity and isolation.[3][1]
- Scroll-driven animations: animation-timeline: view() with animation-range is valid, standards-based syntax for scroll/view timelines.[7][8][1]
- Entry/exit transitions: Using @starting-style and allowing discrete transitions for display/content-visibility matches current recommendations; specifying allow-discrete per property in transition shorthand is the preferred form.[9][10][1]
- Reduced transparency: The prefers-reduced-transparency media feature is now available in Chromium and is safe as progressive enhancement; treating it as optional is appropriate.[11][12][1]

## Anchor positioning notes
- The overview correctly declares anchor-name on triggers and uses position-anchor on the tethered element, which is required for anchor positioning to work.[13][14][1]
- position-area: top and bottom center are valid placement directives, and using position: absolute/fixed is appropriate since both are absolutely positioned boxes per the spec.[14][15][1]
- position-visibility should be guarded with @supports because it is experimental and not yet baseline everywhere, which the document already does.[16][1]
- Important fix: change position-try: bottom, left, right to valid try tactics or named @position-try fallbacks, since position-try accepts try-order plus try-fallbacks (flip-block, flip-inline, flip-start) and/or dashed-ident names, not raw “bottom/left/right” area keywords.[17][18][1]

## Step 01 review
- The combined reset + classless base is well-scoped in @layer reset and provides readable defaults for semantic HTML, matching the “Pico-like” goal without fighting the token system.[2]
- Typography, lists, code blocks, tables, quotes, details/summary, and dialog defaults align with the tokens and match the Claude-like palette intent in the overview.[2][1]
- Buttons and nav get sensible defaults that layer cleanly over tokens and won’t conflict with later component classes under @scope.[1][2]

## Actionable fixes
- Replace invalid position-try values with valid tactics or named fallbacks, for example: position-try: most-height --top-scroll; with @position-try --top-scroll { position-area: top; max-height: 50vh; overflow-y: auto; }, or use flip-block/flip-inline as needed.[18][17][1]
- Keep position-visibility usage behind @supports as shown; consider defaults of anchors-visible or no-overflow only where UX requires hard-hiding.[16][1]
- Prefer the transition shorthand form with allow-discrete per property (as already written) to avoid transition-behavior placement gotchas.[10][9][1]
- If using the test HTML with Vite root: src, reference styles as /assets/css/0-critical/reset-and-base.css or assets/css/0-critical/reset-and-base.css from a file in src, not src/assets/..., to match the provided Vite config.[2][1]

## Compatibility notes
- @scope, view()/scroll() timelines, anchor positioning, and light-dark() are supported in current evergreen browsers and land in 2025 targets; anchoring extras like position-visibility remain experimental, so progressive guards are appropriate.[8][4][3][16][1]
- For older Android/iOS baselines, the progressive strategy here preserves core layout/typography and theming via tokens and color-scheme while selectively enabling advanced features under @supports blocks.[1][2]

## Conclusion
Overall, the architecture and Step 01 are production-ready for a modern 11ty + Vite + LightningCSS stack, with the main requested tweak being to switch position-try fallbacks to valid tactics or named @position-try options, and to keep experimental properties behind @supports as already shown.[18][16][2][1]
