Thank you: you can see the test in action: https://tinybuild-homepage-example.tinymedia.de/test/

i also built a kitchen-sink demo in my own ventojs template setup: https://tinybuild-homepage-example.tinymedia.de/kitchen-sink/

at this point is it okay to ask about some basic questions that we should implement maybe this early: how can we manage an easy system to prevent layout shift and flicker of unrendered content?

is there an easy automatic way to use critical-css? if not and only manually by updating it everytime i update my pages then lets not bother for now, but do what we can to do not have this unstyled content flicker and no layout shifts

also i want the same width regardless of scrollbar with something like:   /* Prevent scrollbar layout shift - 2025 technique */

  overflow-y: scroll; /* Fallback for older browsers */

}

/* Modern scrollbar gutter support */

@supports (scrollbar-gutter: stable) {

  html {

    overflow-y: auto;

    scrollbar-gutter: stable;

  }

(please recheck)

how can we progressively implement /* Multi-page transitions */ in 2025 to work out of the gate with my setup and maybe create a layer where we define the possible view transitions. 

here the feedback from perplexity for step 2: 

(in the 02_feedback.md file)

please read this and my comments - give me maybe updated instructions for step 1 and step 2 and then follow up with step 3 of our build. can you "see" the links in https://tinybuild-homepage-example.tinymedia.de/kitchen-sink/ or should i provide screenshots so you have an idea what styles should be worked on?
